# About The Application

In addition, it uses Java caching (JCache) API, an industrial standard API that allows Java programs to interact with caching systems (Supported starting from Websphere eXtreme Scale Version 8.6.1.1) 

The To-Do List is simple and easy to use, it allows you to add and persist items that you need to get done. You can also mark items as completed and delete them from the list. The items are stored in an Websphere eXtreme Scale grid.
